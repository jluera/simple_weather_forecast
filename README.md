# simple_weather_forecast
## A Project To Build A Simple Weather Forecasting Application In Python.
 
This was a project to learn how to use streamlit to build a simple python web app. 

This code will pull weather forecast data for a given location from the openweathermap.org api, and display it in a streamlit web app.  

In the web app you can select the location and number of days (1-5) to forecast. You can also select the option to display the temperature forecast or you can select the option for weather conditions which are displayed via graphic icons.

## REQUIREMENTS
- plotly
- streamlit
- requests
